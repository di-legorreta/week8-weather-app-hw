# Weather App – Final Project

This is my final project for SheCodes Plus.  
A Weather App built with **Vanilla JavaScript, Axios, HTML & CSS** and deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**.

The app combines a clean glass-style UI over a sunset background with live weather data fetched from the **SheCodes Weather API**.  

---

## Features

- City Search – type any city and get real-time weather data  
- Current Temperature – with large numeric display + aligned °C unit  
- Weather Icon & Description – pulled directly from the API  
- Humidity & Wind – displayed clearly with labels  
- Forecast – 5-day outlook with daily icons and temperatures  
- Responsive Design – optimized for desktop and mobile (glass container over background image)  

---

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)  
- Axios for API requests  
- HTML5 + CSS3 (Glassmorphism styling)  
- Cloudflare Pages for free hosting & deployment  
- SheCodes Weather API as data source
